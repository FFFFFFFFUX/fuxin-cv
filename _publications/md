### Abstract
This thesis develops a spatio-temporal log-ARCH framework combined with a two-step LASSO procedure to analyze volatility spillovers and systemic risk channels across U.S. financial companies.  
The methodology integrates temporal clustering with spatial dependencies, enabling the detection of structural breaks and estimation of interpretable risk interaction networks.

### Key Findings
- **Identified Volatility Spillovers**: Detected cross-sectional volatility transmission across financial firms.  
- **Detected Structural Breaks**: Applied two-step LASSO to capture change points and build a sparse, interpretable network.  
- **Revealed Systemic Risk Channels**: Showed how shocks propagate differently across institutions, highlighting vulnerabilities in smaller firms.  
- **Volatility Dynamics (Visa & Mastercard)**: Results indicate highly similar volatility patterns for Visa and Mastercard, suggesting strong interdependence.
